# slogdev-react-datepicker

A customized version of [react-date-picker](https://reactdatepicker.com//) with improved styling and flexibility, tailored to fit modern design systems.

## âœ¨ Why this fork?

While `react-date-picker` is a robust and well-maintained library for date selection in React projects, design requirements in real-world applications often call for a more refined and brand-consistent UI.

`slogdev-react-datepicker` builds upon the solid foundation of the original library, with enhancements focused on:

- **Improved UI** to better align with modern frontend aesthetics.
- **Customizable themes** for seamless integration into existing design systems.
- **Streamlined defaults** that prioritize clarity, accessibility, and responsiveness.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Fully customizable calendar component
- Responsive design out of the box
- Same powerful API from `react-day-picker`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

npm install slogdev-react-datepicker
# or
yarn add slogdev-react-datepicker
```
